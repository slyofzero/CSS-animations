# CSS-animations
A repository to showcase the CSS animation ideas I came up with. All the projects in this repo use Tailwind CSS with PostCSS with Vanilla HTML and JavaScript.
Any future projects added since 25th Feb, 2022 might also use GSAP with TypeScript instead of just Tailwind and JavaScript.

To view any project simply download that directory, and serve the `index.html` file to a local server either by using the `serve` package or by just using the Live-Server extenstion in VSCode.
